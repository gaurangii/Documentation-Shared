The **Triggers** section allows you to define when the chatbot should appear on the website or mobile screen. Here’s how you can configure it:

1. **Timing for Desktop Trigger**:
   - Set the delay (in seconds) after which the bot should trigger on the desktop screen.
2. **Timing for Mobile Trigger**:
   - Set the delay (in seconds) after which the bot should trigger on the mobile screen.
3. **Chat Bubble Automatic Opening Behavior**:
   - Choose from the following options using the dropdown:
     - **Always Open After Specified Time**: The bot will trigger automatically based on the timing you’ve set in the fields above.
     - **Automatically After Selected Amount of Time**: If the bot is opened and then closed by the user, it will reopen automatically after the time specified in this field.
     - **Never Open Automatically**: The bot will not open automatically. It will only open if the user clicks on it.
4. **Disable Trigger Toggles**:
   - Use these toggles to disable the bot’s trigger separately for the desktop screen or mobile screen.
